Although some features to aid readability may be common to most languages (e.g., the majority of {`}easy{'} words are of low frequency), we believe that lexical complexity is mainly language-specific. In this paper, we define lexical complexity for French and we present a pilot study on the effects of text simplification in dyslexic children. The participants were asked to read out loud original and manually simplified versions of a standardized French text corpus and to answer comprehension questions after reading each text. The analysis of the results shows that the simplifications performed were beneficial in terms of reading speed and they reduced the number of reading errors (mainly lexical ones) without a loss in comprehension. Although the number of participants in this study was rather small (N=10), the results are promising and contribute to the development of applications in computational linguistics.},

  abstract = {As the availability of data for language learning grows, the role of linguistic structure is under scrutiny. At the same time, it is imperative to closely inspect patterns in data which might present loopholes for models to obtain high performance on benchmarks. In a two-part talk, I will address each of these challenges.
First, I will introduce the paradigm of scaffolded learning. Scaffolds enable us to leverage inductive biases from one structural source for prediction of a different, but related structure, using only as much supervision as is necessary. We show that the resulting representations achieve improved performance across a range of tasks, indicating that linguistic structure remains beneficial even with powerful deep learning architectures.
In the second part of the talk, I will showcase some of the properties exhibited by NLP models in large data regimes. Even as these models report excellent performance, sometimes claimed to beat humans, a closer look reveals that predictions are not a result of complex reasoning, and the task is not being completed in a generalizable way. Instead, this success can be largely attributed to exploitation of some artifacts of annotation in the datasets. I will discuss some questions our finding raises, as well as directions for future work.},

We found that from more than one million unique acronyms in our data, just over 2,000 (0.2\%) were used regularly, and most acronyms (79\%) appeared fewer than 10 times. Acronyms are not the biggest current problem in science communication, but reducing their use is a simple change that would help readers and potentially increase the value of science.},

This study also compares these choices for students with and without dyslexia. In all, 440 high school students and their families agreed to take part in this project. Socio-demographic data was collected for the 47 students with dyslexia and 47 class-matched students without dyslexia, along with information on their current schools and their future educational plans. A specially developed questionnaire was used for the students, in combination with structured interviews with their families. The results show significant differences between these groups regarding both choices for university studies and the underlying motivations for these choices. Furthermore, certain psychological and emotional factors are implicated here in the decisions of the students with dyslexia regarding both university studies and their underlying reasons. Future research is needed to further investigate these factors in the educational choices of students with dyslexia.},

End-to-end neural network models have been widely adopted to directly generate the simplified version of input text, usually functioning as a blackbox. We show that text simplification can be decomposed into a compact pipeline of tasks to ensure the transparency and explainability of the process. The first two steps in this pipeline are often neglected: 1) to predict whether a given piece of text needs to be simplified, and 2) if yes, to identify complex parts of the text. The two tasks can be solved separately using either lexical or deep learning methods, or solved jointly. Simply applying explainable complexity prediction as a preliminary step, the out-of-sample text simplification performance of the state-of-the-art, black-box simplification models can be improved by a large margin.},

A basic pipeline approach is used to perform both text adaptation and annotation. First, sentences are preprocessed and word sense disambiguation is performed. Then, the difficulty of each token is estimated by looking at their average age of acquisition and frequency in a corpus of simplified Dutch. We use Cornetto to find synonyms of words that have been identified as difficult and the SONAR500 corpus to perform reverse lemmatisation. Finally, we rely on a largescale language model to verify whether the selected replacement word fits the local context. In addition, the text is augmented with information from Wikipedia (word definitions and links). We tune and evaluate the system with sentences taken from the Flemish newspaper De Standaard. The results show that the system’s adaptation component has low coverage, since it only correctly simplifies around one in five ‘difficult’ words, but reasonable accuracy, with no grammatical errors being introduced in the text. The Wikipedia annotations have a broader coverage, but their potential for simplification needs to be further developed and more thoroughly evaluated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
