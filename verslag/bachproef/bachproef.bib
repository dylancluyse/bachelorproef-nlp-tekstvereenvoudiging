Although some features to aid readability may be common to most languages (e.g., the majority of {`}easy{'} words are of low frequency), we believe that lexical complexity is mainly language-specific. In this paper, we define lexical complexity for French and we present a pilot study on the effects of text simplification in dyslexic children. The participants were asked to read out loud original and manually simplified versions of a standardized French text corpus and to answer comprehension questions after reading each text. The analysis of the results shows that the simplifications performed were beneficial in terms of reading speed and they reduced the number of reading errors (mainly lexical ones) without a loss in comprehension. Although the number of participants in this study was rather small (N=10), the results are promising and contribute to the development of applications in computational linguistics.},

  abstract = {As the availability of data for language learning grows, the role of linguistic structure is under scrutiny. At the same time, it is imperative to closely inspect patterns in data which might present loopholes for models to obtain high performance on benchmarks. In a two-part talk, I will address each of these challenges.
First, I will introduce the paradigm of scaffolded learning. Scaffolds enable us to leverage inductive biases from one structural source for prediction of a different, but related structure, using only as much supervision as is necessary. We show that the resulting representations achieve improved performance across a range of tasks, indicating that linguistic structure remains beneficial even with powerful deep learning architectures.
In the second part of the talk, I will showcase some of the properties exhibited by NLP models in large data regimes. Even as these models report excellent performance, sometimes claimed to beat humans, a closer look reveals that predictions are not a result of complex reasoning, and the task is not being completed in a generalizable way. Instead, this success can be largely attributed to exploitation of some artifacts of annotation in the datasets. I will discuss some questions our finding raises, as well as directions for future work.},

Socio-demographic data was collected for the 47 students with dyslexia and 47 class-matched students without dyslexia, along with information on their current schools and their future educational plans. A specially developed questionnaire was used for the students, in combination with structured interviews with their families. The results show significant differences between these groups regarding both choices for university studies and the underlying motivations for these choices. Furthermore, certain psychological and emotional factors are implicated here in the decisions of the students with dyslexia regarding both university studies and their underlying reasons. Future research is needed to further investigate these factors in the educational choices of students with dyslexia.},

End-to-end neural network models have been widely adopted to directly generate the simplified version of input text, usually functioning as a blackbox. We show that text simplification can be decomposed into a compact pipeline of tasks to ensure the transparency and explainability of the process. The first two steps in this pipeline are often neglected: 1) to predict whether a given piece of text needs to be simplified, and 2) if yes, to identify complex parts of the text. The two tasks can be solved separately using either lexical or deep learning methods, or solved jointly. Simply applying explainable complexity prediction as a preliminary step, the out-of-sample text simplification performance of the state-of-the-art, black-box simplification models can be improved by a large margin.},

A basic pipeline approach is used to perform both text adaptation and annotation. First, sentences are preprocessed and word sense disambiguation is performed. Then, the difficulty of each token is estimated by looking at their average age of acquisition and frequency in a corpus of simplified Dutch. We use Cornetto to find synonyms of words that have been identified as difficult and the SONAR500 corpus to perform reverse lemmatisation. Finally, we rely on a largescale language model to verify whether the selected replacement word fits the local context. In addition, the text is augmented with information from Wikipedia (word definitions and links). We tune and evaluate the system with sentences taken from the Flemish newspaper De Standaard. The results show that the system’s adaptation component has low coverage, since it only correctly simplifies around one in five ‘difficult’ words, but reasonable accuracy, with no grammatical errors being introduced in the text. The Wikipedia annotations have a broader coverage, but their potential for simplification needs to be further developed and more thoroughly evaluated.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

abstract = {Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) is becoming much more important because of the huge amount of textual content that grows exponentially on the Internet and the various archives of news articles, scientific papers, legal documents, etc. Manual text summarization consumes a lot of time, effort, cost, and even becomes impractical with the gigantic amount of textual content. Researchers have been trying to improve ATS techniques since the 1950s. ATS approaches are either extractive, abstractive, or hybrid. The extractive approach selects the most important sentences in the input document(s) then concatenates them to form the summary. The abstractive approach represents the input document(s) in an intermediate representation then generates the summary with sentences that are different than the original sentences. The hybrid approach combines both the extractive and abstractive approaches. Despite all the proposed methods, the generated summaries are still far away from the human-generated summaries. Most researches focus on the extractive approach. It is required to focus more on the abstractive and hybrid approaches. This research provides a comprehensive survey for the researchers by presenting the different aspects of ATS: approaches, methods, building blocks, techniques, datasets, evaluation methods, and future research directions.}

abstract = "In this paper a Neural Network is designed for Part-of-Speech Tagging of Dutch text. Our approach uses the Corpus Gesproken Nederlands (CGN) consisting of almost 9 million transcribed words of spoken Dutch, divided into 15 different categories. The outcome of the design is a Neural Network with an input window of size 8 (4 words back and 3 words ahead) and a hidden layer of 370 neurons. The words ahead are coded based on the relative frequency of the tags in the training set for the word. Special attention is paid to unknown words (words not in the training set) for which such a relative frequency cannot be determined. Based on a 10-fold cross validation an approximation of the relative frequency of tags for unknown words is determined. The performance of the Neural Network is 97.35%, 97.88% on known words and 41.67% on unknown words. This is comparable to state of the art performances found in the literature. The special coding of unknown words resulted of an increase of almost 13% for the tagging of unknown words.",

To obtain term familiarity data, we recruited 21 volunteers who agreed to take medical  terminology quizzes containing 68 terms. We then created predictive models for familiarity based on term occurrence in text corpora and reader's demographics. Although the sample size was small, our preliminary results indicate that predicting the familiarity of medical terms based on an analysis of the frequency in text corpora is feasible. Further, individualized familiarity assessment is feasible when demographic features are included as predictors.",

De impact van deze leerstoornissen in het hoger onderwijs en in de transitie naar de arbeidsmarkt is dan ook onderbelicht. Om hier een kentering in te brengen, werden twee bachelorstudies (één aan de Arteveldehogeschool en één aan HoGent) en een masterstudie (aan UGent) opgezet en werd ook een City of People (CoP) impulsproject ‘Inclusie in 4D’ (zie www.cityofpeople.be) gestart. De bevindingen van deze studies benadrukken dat de impact van leerstoornissen niet stopt nadat men de schoolbanken verlaat. Verder blijkt de nood aan selectieprocedures die een ‘eerlijker’ en ‘rijker’ beeld kunnen geven van de capaciteiten van de volwassenen met dyslexie/dyscalculie. Alleen op die manier kunnen werkgevers vermijden dat ze ‘hidden potentials’ missen. We moeten de arbeidsmarkt dan ook sensibiliseren om de kaart van de ‘diversiteit’ te trekken. Implicaties voor het werken met (jong)volwassenen met leerstoornissen worden belicht.}},
